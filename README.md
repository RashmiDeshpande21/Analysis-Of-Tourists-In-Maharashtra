# Analysis-Of-Tourists-In-Maharashtra

Our data consists of all the tourists domestic and foreign for the years 2011-2014.For each year we have about 1500 data points.We have tourists divided into many categories:Age (15-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-60, > 60), Sex, Purpose of visit, Nationality, Month of arrival, Year of arrival, City / District, Place visited.
Conclusions were drawn on the basis of visualisations, a neural-network based recommendation system was developed.
